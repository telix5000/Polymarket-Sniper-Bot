### Summary

The bot startup log reveals multiple issues that must be isolated, fixed, and debugged:

#### 1. CLOB API Credential Failures and Startup Blocker
- The application repeatedly fails authentication with the CLOB API: `401 Unauthorized/Invalid api key`.
- No credentials cached, credential derivation fails, and attempts fall back to disabled trading mode due to invalid/missing credentials.
- Final state: `ready_to_trade=false` and `auth_ok=false`. Trading is disabled (`DETECT-ONLY mode`).
- The log suggests troubleshooting steps but credentials remain unresolved on restart.

#### 2. Approval Logic Reports Satisfied Despite Auth Failure
- All USDC/ERC1155 allowances and approvals are validated as OK, but the bot is not ready to trade due to the credential issue.

#### 3. Relayer Disabled and Trading Engine Blocked
- Relayer not enabled: `Neither SIGNER_URL nor builder credentials provided; relayer disabled.`
- Trading engine runs detection but does not submit orders: `Active blockers: Invalid or missing CLOB API credentials`.

#### 4. Mempool Monitoring: RPC Endpoint Limitations
- The mempool monitor attempts to use `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` but the RPC provider does not support it.
- The bot falls back to Polymarket API polling instead of true mempool monitoring.
- This limits detection speed and reliability for some RPC endpoints.

### Tasks to Address
1. **Investigate and resolve CLOB API credential derivation failures.**
    - Review credential generation logic and environment variables (PRIVATE_KEY, etc).
    - Check wallet interaction instructions (connect, trade on website, restart bot, etc).
    - Improve error reporting for invalid credentials and guidance for correct generation.
2. **Isolate why approvals report success when credentials fail; fix approval/auth checks to surface correct startup blockers.**
3. **Enhance startup diagnostics to clearly separate authentication and allowance approval logic.**
4. **Improve RPC configuration/mempool monitor fallback mechanisms.**
    - If possible, allow automatic detection of supported methods.
    - Provide clearer logs/guidance for RPC endpoint capabilities.
5. **Document all troubleshooting steps and error situations in the README.**
6. **Add automated tests for credential derivation and authentication flows.**
