/**
 * Scalp Take-Profit Strategy with Exit Ladder
 *
 * A time-and-momentum-based profit-taking strategy that:
 * 1. Takes profits on positions held 30-120 minutes (configurable per preset)
 * 2. Requires +4-12% profit threshold (configurable per risk preset)
 *    - Conservative: 8-12%, Balanced: 5-8%, Aggressive: 4-6%
 * 3. Checks momentum indicators before exiting:
 *    - Price slope over last N ticks
 *    - Spread widening
 *    - Bid depth thinning
 * 4. CRITICAL SAFEGUARD: Never forces time-based exit on positions where:
 *    - Entry price ≤ 60¢ (speculative tier)
 *    - AND current price ≥ 90¢ (near resolution)
 *    These are $1.00 winners - let them ride to resolution!
 *
 * EXIT LADDER (Jan 2025 Refactor):
 * When a scalp is triggered (sudden spike, target profit reached, etc.), the
 * position enters an ExitPlan state machine that guarantees eventual exit:
 *
 * Stage A - PROFIT (first SCALP_EXIT_WINDOW_SEC * 0.6):
 *   - Attempt SELL at target profit price (or bestBid if higher)
 *   - Retry every SCALP_PROFIT_RETRY_SEC with slightly lower limit
 *
 * Stage B - BREAKEVEN (remaining time in window):
 *   - If bestBid >= avgEntryPrice, sell at avgEntry (or bestBid if higher)
 *   - Still avoids loss, just releases capital
 *
 * Stage C - FORCE (when window expires):
 *   - Sell at bestBid immediately, even at loss
 *   - Frees capital, prevents stuck positions
 *
 * Stage D - EXIT_DEFERRED_ILLQ (illiquid book detected):
 *   - When bestBid is far below target/minAcceptable OR spread is extreme
 *   - DO NOT spam market-sell attempts (price protection would block anyway)
 *   - Transition to deferred state with escalating backoff (1m, 5m, 15m)
 *   - Periodically recheck liquidity; resume normal exit ladder when book normalizes
 *   - After MAX_ILLIQUID_RECHECKS (10), abandon the exit plan
 *
 * ILLIQUID EXIT CONDITIONS:
 * - Extreme spread: bestAsk - bestBid > 30¢
 * - Tiny bid: bestBid ≤ 2¢ while target > 50¢
 * - Bid far below acceptable: bestBid < minAcceptable * 0.5
 *
 * NON-NEGOTIABLES:
 * - Sell sizing uses position notional (sharesHeld * limitPrice), NOT profitUsd
 * - If notional < MIN_ORDER_USD, treat as DUST and skip
 * - If no bestBid (NO_BOOK), mark as BLOCKED and retry with backoff
 * - If ILLIQUID, defer exits with escalating backoff to prevent infinite retry loops
 *
 * This strategy is designed to churn out consistent winners by
 * taking profits when momentum is fading, rather than waiting
 * indefinitely for resolution or $1.00.

 * - Minimum: 5% (to clear ~3% costs and still profit)
 * - Target: 8%+ (meaningful profit after all costs)
 * - Never scalp below 5% - you're just paying fees!
 */

/**
 * Default configuration - balanced settings
 *
 * PROFIT TARGETS: Must clear transaction costs (fees + slippage + spread)!
 * A 3% "profit" can easily become a loss after costs. Target 5%+ minimum.
 *
 * TIME WINDOWS: We ALWAYS respect the time window. No early exits!
 * - Wait at least minHoldMinutes before considering ANY exit
 * - After minHoldMinutes, exit only when profit >= target AND momentum fading
 * - After maxHoldMinutes, exit if profit >= minimum (don't let winners sit forever)
 *
 * EXCEPTION - SUDDEN SPIKE: If price spikes massively in a short window
 * (e.g., +15% in 10 minutes), capture it immediately - such moves often reverse.
 *
 * ENTRY TIMES (STATELESS, SURVIVES RESTARTS):
 * This strategy uses EntryMetaResolver to derive entry timestamps from the
 * Polymarket trade history API. This is STATELESS - no disk persistence.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS:
 * Previously, entry times were tracked since container start. After container
 * restarts/redeploys, the "time held" clock reset and the scalper missed valid
 * take-profit opportunities on positions already in the green (e.g., showing
 * "20min" when the position was actually held for hours/days).
 *
 * NOW: timeHeldSec is computed from actual trade history timestamps:
 * - firstAcquiredAt: timestamp of the first BUY that contributed to position
 * - timeHeldSec = now - firstAcquiredAt (stable across restarts)
 *
 * See EntryMetaResolver and Position.timeHeldSec for implementation details.
