 * - Order execution delays
 * - Market microstructure noise
 *
 * CRITICAL: Without slippage tolerance, sell orders will fail if the best bid

 *
 * A 2% slippage on a highly profitable trade (e.g., +42% gain) is acceptable

 * - Stop-loss/urgent exits: 10% (accept any reasonable price to exit)
 * - Stale position cleanup: 3% (tighter to protect small profits)
 * - Normal profit-taking: 2% (default - balance execution vs value)
