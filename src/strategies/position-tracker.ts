   * Enrich ACTIVE positions with entry metadata from trade history.

   * After container restarts, the clock reset and the scalper missed valid
   * take-profit opportunities on positions already in the green.
   *
   * This method derives entry metadata (cost basis, timestamps) from the
   * Polymarket trade history API - data that survives container restarts.
   *
   * WHAT IT PROVIDES:
   * - avgEntryPriceCents: Weighted average entry price from trade history
   * - firstAcquiredAt: Timestamp of first BUY that contributes to position
   * - lastAcquiredAt: Timestamp of most recent BUY that increased position
   * - timeHeldSec: now - firstAcquiredAt (stable across restarts!)
   *
   * TOKENID-BASED:
   * All calculations use tokenId as primary key. This works for any binary
   * outcome type (YES/NO, Over/Under, TeamA/TeamB, etc.).
   *
   * @returns Array of ACTIVE positions with entry metadata fields populated
